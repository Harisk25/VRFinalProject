# VRFinalProject
 
This project was done in part of my Capstone project for computer science degree. The project simulates a Physics optic lab. This project was developed for and tested on a Meta Quest 3 headeset. 

The project explores the laws of reflection and refraction. To simulate light, the line render component is manpulated through code to behave as light.

If you are using a Meta Quest headset you can build the project APK and install it onto the headset through sidequest. You can also build for windows if you have another headset connect to the computer.
