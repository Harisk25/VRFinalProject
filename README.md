# VRFinalProject
 
<b>This project was part of my Capstone project for my computer science degree. A paper was written which was focused on this project's development and the pilot study done after the development. The paper has since been published at iLRN 11th International Conference of the Immersive Learning Research Network, and you can watch the paper presentation [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyETcYL4Orw&list=PLKNj_u8IflVGLg8gduvsoShDAp3FIimMw&index=53) and read the paper [here](https://publications.immersivelrn.org/index.php/practitioner/article/view/411). </b>

<h2>Project Overview</h2>

The project simulates a Physics optic lab. This project was developed for and tested on a Meta Quest 3 headset. To simulate a light beam, the Unity line render is utilised as it has a built-in function for reflection, and through the use of vector math, the line renderer can be manipulated to simulate refraction. The light beam can simulate reflection, refraction, and the phenomena' total internal reflection. 

Besides that, this educational virtual reality application has a tutorial - to allow the player to gain familiarity with the controls - and three activities with a puzzle-based scenario and an interactive blackboard UI object which convays the infromation to the player. The first activity covers reflection, the second covers refraction, and the third covers total internal reflection with a more challenging puzzle.

<h3>Accessability</h3>

This educational virtual reality application has a few accessability features:
- Height adjustment
- enable snap turning
- teleportation

<h2>How to play</h2>

If you are using a Meta Quest headset you can install the APK onto the headset through sidequest. You can also use the windows build for windows if you have another headset connect to the computer.
